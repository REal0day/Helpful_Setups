*Make sure to have a RPI3 installed with the latest version of Raspbian

1 – This is following the implementation within the Kali Linux set up video. You’re going to install the git files: sudo git clone –recursive https://www.githib.com/Nuand/bladeRF
2 – When you have the github files within your system, navigate to them. 
3- Once within the githib bladeRF directory, make sure you locate the CMakelists.txt file.
4 – If you don’t have CMake installed, do so with: sudo apt-get install cmake
5 – Next input: make -j4
*The -j4 is to speed up the compilation process
6 – Next input: make install
5 – Next input: sudo ldconfig
6 – At this point, if you plug in the BladeRF, the device should be discoverable. Input: bladeRF-cli -i
*This will enable interactive mode.
7 – While in interactive mode, input: version
* This will display the firmware and FGPA versions within the BladeRF. Currently, the firmware should show up, but the FPGA should be empty. 
8 – Do download the proper FPGA file(s), look on the back of your BladeRF. There should be a sticker on the back displaying: A4, A115, ect. This corresponds to the FPGA type for this BladeRF.
Grab the latest version FPGA image for your device.

On the back of you device, you can see one of the following:
 BladeRF A4
 BladeRF A9
 BladeRF x40
 BladeRF x115

9 – Once you have your sticker information, navigate to: https://www.nuand.com/fgpa_images/
10 – My implementation followed: Place the FGPA file on the desktop
11 – Within a terminal window, navigate to the Desktop
12 – Within the terminal window, input: bladeRF -l (FGPA file name)
*Disregard the braces. Simply input the FGPA file name
13 – At this point, if the instillation is performed correctly, you can navigate back to interactive mode by inputting: bladeRF-cli -i
14 – To verify that everything is complete, input: version 
15 – If done correctly, both the firmware and FGPA should have something displayed.
